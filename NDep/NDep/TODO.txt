- add version class and adopt the maven version range format
- add ability to query repo for latest version of a given artifact, latest release etc
- possibly cache above info and only update on change?
- split dependency into raw and extended or something. One is for json, the other logic
- create a dependency resolver which will do all the hard work
- for project only use require deps, not all listed in the soln.
